    Financial inclusion means the that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, 
    credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. Access to a transaction account is a first step toward broader financial inclusion since it allows people to store

    The UFA goal is that by 2020, adults, who currently aren't part of the formal financial system, have access to a transaction account to store money, send and receive payments as the 
    basic building block to manage their financial lives.Sri Lanka has achieved a high level of financial inclusion compared to other South Asian countries. Its financial sector comprises 
    a wide range of financial institutions providing financial services such as loans, savings, pawning, leasing and finance, and remittance and money transfer facilities. There is also 
    evidence that a larger share of households in Sri Lanka accesses multiple financial institutions for their credit and savings needs. However, the use of insurance services, ATM facilities, 
    e-payments, and mobile banking, is relatively low. Financial education is ad hoc and lags behind financial innovation and new products. The information technology (IT) literacy rate is only
    35% in Sri Lanka, and with the growing IT–finance nexus, financial awareness and education have become all the more important. Strengthening the regulatory framework governing the 
    microfinance sector and client protection is also crucial for improving financial inclusion in Sri Lanka. Much scope remains to improve financial inclusion, particularly related to cost 
    and quality of financial services provided, and the sustainability of financial institutions.

    Financial inclusion is positioned prominently as an enabler of other developmental goals in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, where it is featured as a target in eight of the 
    seventeen goals. These include SDG1, on eradicating poverty; SDG 2 on ending hunger, achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture; SDG 3 on profiting health and
     well-being; SDG 5 on achieving gender equality and economic empowerment of women; SDG 8 on promoting economic growth and jobs; SDG 9 on supporting industry, innovation, and infrastructure; 
     and SDG 10 on reducing inequality. Additionally, in SDG 17 on strengthening the means of implementation there is an implicit role for greater financial inclusion through greater savings 
     mobilization for investment and consumption that can spur growth.

    There is academic evidence that financial inclusion models can support overall economic growth and the achievement of broader development goals. Digital finance alone could benefit
     billions of people by spurring inclusive growth that adds $3.7 trillion to the GDP of emerging economies within a decade, according to a recent report by the McKinsey Global Institute. 
     The results of a long-term impact study on a mobile money service in Kenya, M-PESA, found mobile money has lifted as many as 194,000 households – 2% of the Kenyan population – out of 
     poverty, and has been effective in improving the economic lives of poor women and of members of female-headed households. There is also growing evidence of financial 
    inclusion creating more stable financial systems and economies, mobilizing domestic resources through national savings and helping to boost government revenue.

      UNCDF’s last mile financing models support banks, cooperatives, microfinance institutions, money transfer companies and mobile network operators to extend the reach of financial markets
       where they would otherwise not go. UNCDF ensures that suitable financial products (savings, credit, insurance, payments, and remittances) are available to individuals – notably the excluded 
       and underbanked – and micro, small, and medium enterprises, at a reasonable cost, and on a sustainable basis. In particular, UNCDF targets women based on the growing evidence that access to 
       savings leads to positive economic outcomes for women, including increasing productivity and profits and greater investment in their businesses. Having savings also makes women less likely
        to sell assets to address health emergencies, stabilizes their incomes in times of economic shocks, and provides greater control over their funds.
