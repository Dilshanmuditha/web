    Science is an effective process that we use to help us understand the world. By making testable predictions and then observing what actually happens, we are able to explain the underlying systems of nature with increasingly accurate models. We can then use these models and explanations to help us predict the likely effects of our choices so that we can make our decisions wisely. Technology continues to enhance our ability to understand the world by improving our ability to accurately monitor natural events. It is also crucial in sustainable development when we become more resource-efficient by finding ways to improve our quality of life while at the same time reducing the amount of resources we use in providing these new goods and services.

    Perhaps nowhere is science and technology more important than in relation to the Earth’s carrying capacity. Carrying capacity refers to the number of people that our planet’s resources can support with our currently implemented technology and can be increased by using our resources more efficiently with improved technology. By understanding and monitoring the natural processes that affect the carrying capacity, science and technology can provide the information needed for environmentally sound development. It can help us imagine more options for environment and development choices in the decision-making process. In order to fulfill the promise of this key area, it can be helpful to develop understanding of key environmental science topics. This will improve long-term scientific assessments, help support sustainable development, and ensure that science is responsive to our emerging needs

    scientific basis for sustainable management takes different levels of planning when we consider building a treehouse, a single-family home, or a high-rise skyscraper. As the project complexity and the potential impact to those around it increases, it becomes essential to accurately understand how it will impact others both today and in the future. Similarly, as our modern human society becomes more complex, acquiring a realistic long-term perspective will help ensure that our current development is successful. Just as a single skyscraper is built successfully by involving scientists and engineers, so too can our development as a whole benefit from incorporating the scientific process and body of knowledge.

    If we are to move toward sustainable development, the industrialized countries will have to accept special responsibility—not only because of their past ecological sins, but also because of their present technological know-how and financial resources. Yet, one must keep in mind that sustainable production and consumption involve not merely technical progress, but also cultural patterns of individual behavior and values.
    The German government has chosen the socio-ecological market economy (okologische und soziale Markwirtschaft) as the framework for shaping production and consumption in keeping with sustainable development, while at the same time encouraging innovation in industry and society. The key is to sever the traditional link between economic growth and the consumption of resources, which increasingly threatens the natural basis
     for life and the preservation of natural and landscape diversity.

      <br><b>Ideas for those interested in implementation</b>
      <ol>
       <li>Coordinate existing data and statistics gathering systems relevant to developmental and environmental issues so as to support preparation of long-term scientific
        assessments; apply the data obtained to local environment/development assessments; and demonstrate the wide distribution of the assessments in a form that is responsive
         to public needs and can be widely understood</li>
         <li> Create or assist existing programs to carry out individual and local audits that can help to refine the pattern and character of development, examining in particular 
          the capacities of global and regional life-supporting systems to meet the needs of human and non-human life forms and identifying areas and resources vulnerable to 
          further degradation<br></li>
