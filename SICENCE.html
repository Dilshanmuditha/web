    Science is an effective process that we use to help us understand the world. By making testable predictions and then observing what actually happens, we are able to explain the underlying systems of nature with increasingly accurate models. We can then use these models and explanations to help us predict the likely effects of our choices so that we can make our decisions wisely. Technology continues to enhance our ability to understand the world by improving our ability to accurately monitor natural events. It is also crucial in sustainable development when we become more resource-efficient by finding ways to improve our quality of life while at the same time reducing the amount of resources we use in providing these new goods and services.

    Perhaps nowhere is science and technology more important than in relation to the Earth’s carrying capacity. Carrying capacity refers to the number of people that our planet’s resources can support with our currently implemented technology and can be increased by using our resources more efficiently with improved technology. By understanding and monitoring the natural processes that affect the carrying capacity, science and technology can provide the information needed for environmentally sound development. It can help us imagine more options for environment and development choices in the decision-making process. In order to fulfill the promise of this key area, it can be helpful to develop understanding of key environmental science topics. This will improve long-term scientific assessments, help support sustainable development, and ensure that science is responsive to our emerging needs

    scientific basis for sustainable management takes different levels of planning when we consider building a treehouse, a single-family home, or a high-rise skyscraper. As the project complexity and the potential impact to those around it increases, it becomes essential to accurately understand how it will impact others both today and in the future. Similarly, as our modern human society becomes more complex, acquiring a realistic long-term perspective will help ensure that our current development is successful. Just as a single skyscraper is built successfully by involving scientists and engineers, so too can our development as a whole benefit from incorporating the scientific process and body of knowledge.

    If we are to move toward sustainable development, the industrialized countries will have to accept special responsibility—not only because of their past ecological sins, but also because of their present technological know-how and financial resources. Yet, one must keep in mind that sustainable production and consumption involve not merely technical progress, but also cultural patterns of individual behavior and values.

    Improving data, monitoring and accountability: Governments and institutions are increasingly aware of the importance of harnessing data to better inform decision making. Lack of reliable data on even the most basic indicators of development can lead to misguided policies and misallocation of resources. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased between 2010 and 2015, including the least developed countries, though many lack such a plan. Data on population, housing and deaths are essential for development policies, yet collection of this data remains far from universal. Between 2006 - 2015, 88% of developing countries conducted at least one population and housing census, but only 67% of countries in Southern Asia and 69% of countries in Western Asia did so. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 9 in 53 countries collected death registration data and only 8 in 53 collected birth registration data.
