    Goal 17 calls for renewed partnership across governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors to mobilize resources to address all the Goals. Support for developing countries is fundamental for equitable progress for all nations. Overseas financial aid is critical for ensuring sustainable development and some progress has already been made in securing these resources. Though there is significant work yet to be done, in 2016, net overseas development assistance (ODA) from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD rose by 8.9% to $142.6 billion (a new high). Six countries – Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK – met a UN target to keep ODA at or above 0.7% of gross national income. Robust data and measurement is important to strengthen implementation of the Goals and multi-stakeholder partnerships. In 2016, 125 countries engaged in country-led monitoring of development effectiveness, and 54 of those countries reported progress towards those commitments. Technology is specifically highlighted in SDG 17 as a key means of achieving the goals; through increasing access and affordability of ICT services, operationalizing the global technology bank and promoting environmentally sound technologies.

    Mobilizing financial resources: Financial resources for development must continue to increase, through international aid, domestic revenue collection as well as alternative sources such as remittances. Although total development assistance continues to grow, aid to the poorest countries has stagnated. Remittances sent by international migrants to their home countries have a profound impact on families, communities and countries. In 2016, international remittances totaled $575 billion, 75% of which went to developing countries.

    Increasing capacity, collaboration and knowledge sharing: Building the capacity and ability for national governments and institutions to enable sustainable development is important for the global community, and partnerships will be a crucial means to achieving this. In 2015, aid for capacity-building stood at $21 billion, representing 19% of total aid. Sub-Saharan Africa received 27% of this, and South and Central Asia received 20%, with the main recipients of capacity-building assistance being public administration, environment and energy sectors.

    Enhancing the use of enabling technologies: Developing countries in particular need to develop technology ecosystems in order to achieve the Goals, yet WEF finds that lower income countries have significantly less capacity to leverage technology for competitiveness and wellbeing. This will rely on global collaboration with particular focus on building the capacity of developing countries. The Technology Bank is an initiative that aims to strengthen national technology capabilities and provide expertise to the world’s least developed countries.

    Improving data, monitoring and accountability: Governments and institutions are increasingly aware of the importance of harnessing data to better inform decision making. Lack of reliable data on even the most basic indicators of development can lead to misguided policies and misallocation of resources. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased between 2010 and 2015, including the least developed countries, though many lack such a plan. Data on population, housing and deaths are essential for development policies, yet collection of this data remains far from universal. Between 2006 - 2015, 88% of developing countries conducted at least one population and housing census, but only 67% of countries in Southern Asia and 69% of countries in Western Asia did so. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 9 in 53 countries collected death registration data and only 8 in 53 collected birth registration data.
