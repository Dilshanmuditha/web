            <p>Trade for Sustainable Development (T4SD) is a partnership-based programme which helps businesses, regardless of their position in the value chain, chart their path to more sustainable trade by better understanding the sustainability initiatives landscape and to connect with business partners.

 

              T4SD's new platform, Sustainability Map, integrates the already well-established tools such as Standards Map and SustainabilityXchange to the new interconnected modules, the "Network" and "Trends".
              
               
              
              The Programme is supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affair (SECO) and German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).</p>
          
            <p>Trade liberalisation and globalisation can have both positive and negative effects on sustainable development. There is a continued need to support efforts by developing countries to integrate themselves into and derive benefits from the multilateral trading system. At the same time, attention also must be given to enhancing the contribution of the multilateral trading system to sustainable development.</p>

            <p>A supportive international economic environment is crucial. Agenda 21 calls for "a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by:
              promoting sustainable development through trade liberalisation;
              making trade and environment mutually supportive;
              providing adequate financial resources to developing countries dealing with international debt; and
              encouraging macroeconomic policies conducive to environment and development."</p>

            <p>Trade and sustainable development were discussed at the first, second, third, fourth and fifth session of the Commission. Within the framework of the Commission's multi-year programme of work, this issue was again discussed at the eighth session, together with economic growth and investment, as one of the major cross-sectoral themes.</p>
