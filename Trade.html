    Trade for Sustainable Development (T4SD) is a partnership-based programme which helps businesses, regardless of their position in the value chain, chart their 
    path to more sustainable trade by better understanding the sustainability initiatives landscape and to connect with business partners.
T4SD's new platform, Sustainability Map, integrates the already well-established tools such as Standards Map and SustainabilityXchange to the new interconnected modules, the "Network" and "Trends".
The Programme is supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affair (SECO) and German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

    In most international organizations, including the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), conventional wisdom is that international trade supports sustainable development. “Trade growth enhances a country’s income generating capacity, which is one of the essential prerequisites for achieving sustainable development,” the WTO noted in the 2016 UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.

    This belief is usually based on the relationship between trade and only one — or, at most, two — of the three pillars of sustainability. These pillars are: the economy, social interests, and the environment.
<br><br><br>
It’s pretty obvious how trade can support the economic pillar of sustainable development. Over the past few decades, we’ve seen the significant role of global trade in reducing poverty, creating jobs, and promoting growth. According to the World Bank and the WTO, developing countries made up 48 percent of world trade in 2015, up from 33 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, the number of people living in extreme poverty was cut in half between 1990 and 2015. Trade helps provide more and better jobs to people, lower prices for products, and stimulate the growth necessary to end poverty. (See Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #1, which aims to eradicate poverty, and SDG #8, which focuses on decent work and inclusive economic growth.)
<br><br>
The effect of trade on social interests is more mixed. The economic benefits of trade can empower people to address major social needs in their communities, like protecting human rights, improving working conditions, and achieving gender equality. Further, trade agreements and rules also have the potential to serve as social safeguards. In 2011, the WTO estimated that 75 percent of the world’s countries were bound by a free trade agreement (FTA) that included provisions addressing human rights. In 2013, around 120 of the 190 countries that were parties to FTAs were parties to an FTA that includes labor rights protections. All of European Union’s trade agreements contain gender equality regulations. (See SDG #5, which aims to end gender discrimination, and SDG #8.) On the other hand, trade agreements can lead to worsening working conditions, as NAF TA has demonstrated. In addition, these provisions are difficult to enforce.

    But the big subject that’s overlooked, at least in the SDGs, is how trade can help the environment. The relationship between trade and the environment is complex and certainly not 
    always positive. For example, the global agricultural trade has caused agricultural expansion, deforestation, and biodiversity loss in producer countries. Exports of soya and palm 
    oil bring revenue to countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia, but the intensive farming of these crops also causes rainforest and habitat destruction, overfarming, and the 
    destruction of soil and water. 
    (See SDG #6, which focuses on reducing water scarcity and improving access to clean water, and SDG #15, which aims to conserve land-based ecosystems like forests and wetlands.)

      scientific basis for sustainable management takes different levels of planning when we consider building a treehouse, a single-family 
      home, or a high-rise skyscraper. As the project complexity and the potential impact to those around it increases, it becomes essential 
      to accurately understand how it will impact others both today and in the future. Similarly, as our modern human society becomes more complex, 
      acquiring a realistic long-term perspective will help ensure that our current development is successful. Just as a single skyscraper is built 
      successfully by involving scientists and engineers, so too can our development as a whole benefit from incorporating the scientific process and body of knowledge.
      <br><b>Ideas for those interested in implementation</b>
      <ol>
       <li>Coordinate existing data and statistics gathering systems relevant to developmental and environmental issues so as to support preparation of long-term scientific
        assessments; apply the data obtained to local environment/development assessments; and demonstrate the wide distribution of the assessments in a form that is responsive
         to public needs and can be widely understood</li>
         <li> Create or assist existing programs to carry out individual and local audits that can help to refine the pattern and character of development, examining in particular 
          the capacities of global and regional life-supporting systems to meet the needs of human and non-human life forms and identifying areas and resources vulnerable to 
          further degradation<br></li>
