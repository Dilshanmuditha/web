            <p>Trade for Sustainable Development (T4SD) is a partnership-based programme which helps businesses, regardless of their position in the value chain, chart their path to more 
              sustainable trade by better understanding the sustainability initiatives landscape and to connect with business partners.
              T4SD's new platform, Sustainability Map, integrates the already well-established tools such as Standards Map and SustainabilityXchange to the new interconnected modules, the "Network" and "Trends".
              The Programme is supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affair (SECO) and German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).</p>

            <p><h4>Principle 1: Support and promote sustainable trade practices, with regards to social, environmental, economic and management, quality and ethics issues at stake in the production, processing and trading of goods and services.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h3>Transparency</h3></p>
            <p><h4>Principle 2: Contribute to efficiency in global supply chains by clear demonstration of openness to sharing good practices, to foster transparency, trust and inclusiveness at all levels of global supply chains.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h3>Harmonization</h3></p>
            <p><h4>Principle 3: Build on existing resources and methodologies with a collaborative approach avoiding duplication that may provoke proliferation of standards, multiplication of audits or assessment methodologies.
            </h4></p>
            <p><h3>Sustainable development goals (SDGs)</h3></p>
            <p><h4>Principle 4: Act in alignment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, otherwise known as the Global Goals, addressing the root causes of poverty and the universal need for development that works for all people.
