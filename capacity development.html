   Pact has been strengthening groups and communities around the world for more over 40 years, and is a pioneer and innovator in what is today one of the most crucial fields in international development. Community-based organizations, civil society organizations, advocacy groups, and government agencies all fall within this category. We assist companies, governments, and systems in developing development agendas, planning for change, and taking effective action as a worldwide partner with considerable experience in holistic, integrated development.

  <p>
      Capacity development is viewed by Pact as a method, a process, and a result. Our capacity-building approach is deliberate, goes beyond knowledge transfer, depends on co-creation and co-implementation, creatively incorporates technology, and works agilely within complex, adaptive systems.

  <p>
     Pact has just released a new set of capacity building tools based on Capacity Development 2.0. This concept entails carefully integrating programming efforts into a larger local systems approach. Delineating, mapping, and evaluating important systems are the first steps.The Pact and its partners then collaborate to develop action and change plans that include all stakeholders necessary to achieve real social change. Pact and partners identify and harness possibilities, as well as link them to supporting and strengthening capacities as needed. The highly inclusive co-design procedures that resulted give out a clear path forward.

  <p>
      Pact and its partners can record qualitative and quantitative data to track and understand organizations' progress using Pact's Capacity Solutions Platform, or CSP. The CSP has already been utilized by over 2,500 organizations in 30 countries, and is an essential tool in Pact's continuous endeavor to move the historical locus of development change out of the "project" environment and into the proper local context.

  Pact also uses Collective Impact, an open-source, evidence-based methodology that makes systems-based change approaches relatively simple to grasp and co-implement, especially for nascent local groups.
