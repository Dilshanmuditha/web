    Sustainability is usually defined as meeting
    today’s needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. 
    The financial industry can play an increasing role in trying to achieve this. 
    The term ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ was coined by 19th century British economist William 
    Foster Lloyd to describe a hypothetical situation involving the overgrazing of common land in medieval Britain. It is a metaphor for the degradation and eventual depletion of 
    shared resources.
<br><br>
The dilemma at its heart relates to the link between self-interest and open access, where
 individuals put self-interest above the common good. And it is a classic example of coordination failure, which could be resolved by dividing the resources into individual parcels, 
 or through the 
 introduction of a government-enforced quota system.
This lies at the heart of many of the sustainability issues we encounter today. A recent example involves CO2 emissions from the global shipping industry. Due to the principle of 
freedom of the open sea, shipping companies had escaped regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that according to the Economist magazine were higher than the whole of Germany.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    This changed in April 2018 when the International Maritime Organization set binding targets to bring the industry in line with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. 
    These include cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050 (compared with 2008 levels). International collaboration has proven to be key in resolving this coordination problem.

Aviation, an industry not directly included in the UN climate agreement, also has a plan in place to reduce emissions. It has set out three goals: a global average fuel 
efficiency improvement of 2% per year up to 2050; carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onwards; and a 50% absolute reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 (compared with 2005 levels).

As an alternative to regulation, governments could choose to put a price on carbon to solve the coordination problem – for instance, via a cap and permit system, or by 
means of a simple levy. While this is already happening to a limited extent, an estimated 85% of global emissions are currently not covered by such measures.

    Related to the tragedy of the commons is the fact that the world’s population is expected to approach 10 billion by 2050. Despite ongoing innovation and productivity increases, future generations will face increasing resource scarcity and challenges linked to climate change – not just environmental consequences, but also social effects such as climate migration.
<br><br><br>
These developments strongly indicate the need for a more circular economy, based on much lower rates of natural resource extraction and use, in contrast to today’s largely traditional linear economy. According to the OECD, the amount of materials extracted from natural resources and consumed worldwide has doubled since 1980 and is ten times higher than in 1900. The rapid industrialization of emerging economies and continued high levels of consumption in developed countries are responsible for this trend.
<br><br>
Therefore, the challenge for businesses and economies is to grow in a way that can be facilitated by the Earth’s natural resources in the long term without depleting them. Circularity can play a key role in countering the negative effects of the current over-consumption crisis.

    But the big subject that’s overlooked, at least in the SDGs, is how trade can help the environment. The relationship between trade and the environment is complex and certainly not 
    always positive. For example, the global agricultural trade has caused agricultural expansion, deforestation, and biodiversity loss in producer countries. Exports of soya and palm 
    oil bring revenue to countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia, but the intensive farming of these crops also causes rainforest and habitat destruction, overfarming, and the 
    destruction of soil and water. 
    (See SDG #6, which focuses on reducing water scarcity and improving access to clean water, and SDG #15, which aims to conserve land-based ecosystems like forests and wetlands.)

    <p>
      Trade may also be an obstacle to combating climate change. According to the WTO and the UN, open trade would increase industrial production and eventually increase CO2 emissions. Also, 
      “trade may increase the vulnerability to climate change of some countries because it leads them to specialize in the production of products in which they have a comparative advantage, 
      while relying on imports to meet their
       requirements for other goods and services. These countries may become vulnerable if climate change leads to an interruption in their supply of imported goods and services.” (See SDG 
       #13, which focuses on the need for climate action.) <br><br>

Although some FTAs have environmental protection provisions on paper, they are seldom able to be enforced. Even though there have been documented violations, no Party has ever brought a formal 
case based on the environmental provisions of any US FTA. In fact, the enforcement of trade provisions usually does the opposite of protecting the environment: Companies regularly use 
Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) to sue governments for enacting and upholding laws that are meant to protect the environment and communities. This failure to enforce hinders society’s 
progress toward sustainability.

      <p>
        So, how do we mitigate the harms caused by trade to sustainable development? Sometimes, trade itself can be a solution. In the previous example, if climate change leads to a 
        scarcity of certain goods and services in a country, trade can be a means for the country to obtain what it needs from other regions of the world. In other situations, we may 
        combine trade with other economic, social, or environmental methods for a positive outcome. For instance, countries and cities signed the Paris Agreement in April 2016 and the 
        Chicago Climate Charter in December 2017, committing to international and local efforts to tackle global temperature rise.
<br><br>
Trade impacts different aspects of sustainability in various ways, both positively and negatively. It has a rich context in the real world, so we must understand the full scope of the
 effects of trade when talking about it as an engine or impediment for sustainability. But trade is not the only tool we have. Sustainable development depends on thoughtful use of the 
 whole toolbox, and tailoring it to achieve all three pillars of the goals. <br><br>
