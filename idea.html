   This platform is for new comers who are willing to join the industry.The word “innovation” is derived from the Latin verb innovare, 
   which means to renew. In essence, the word has retained its meaning up until today. Innovation means to improve or to replace something, for example, 
   a process, a product, or a service. In the context of companies, however, the term needs a definition. In the complex context of business, a definition is needed.
   <li> Innovation is a process by which a domain, a product, or a service is renewed and brought up to date by applying new processes, introducing new techniques, or establishing successful ideas to create new value. </li>

           continuous improvement in terms of costs are important for them.  </li><br>
