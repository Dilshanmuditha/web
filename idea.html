   This platform is for new comers who are willing to join the industry.The word “innovation” is derived from the Latin verb innovare, 
   which means to renew. In essence, the word has retained its meaning up until today. Innovation means to improve or to replace something, for example, 
   a process, a product, or a service. In the context of companies, however, the term needs a definition. In the complex context of business, a definition is needed.
   <li> Innovation is a process by which a domain, a product, or a service is renewed and brought up to date by applying new processes, introducing new techniques, or establishing successful ideas to create new value. </li>

  <h2><b>Why is innovation so important?</b></h2>

      <li> Companies that choose price leadership must secure their long-term competitiveness by developing innovative, highly efficient processes. Process optimization and
           continuous improvement in terms of costs are important for them.  </li><br>
      <li> Companies that strive for a differentiation strategy need innovation to develop unique distinguishing features to their competitors.  </li><br>
      <li> Many start-ups launch their activities by developing an innovative product or service. </li><br>

    For the role that finance can play, targeted investment can be instrumental in the redeployment of capital to sustainable activities. A key role of financial markets is the efficient 
    allocation of resources to the most financially viable companies, not just in the present, but even more critically, in the future.
    <br><br>
    Financial materiality is the critical link at the intersection of sustainability and business performance. More specifically, investors should focus on identifying the most important 
    intangible factors (sustainability factors) that relate to companies’ ability to create 
    long-term value. For instance, lowering energy consumption in manufacturing processes results in significant cost-saving opportunities and has a direct impact on a company’s bottom line
    <br>
    Going a bit deeper, financial materiality is defined as any intangible factor that can have an impact on a company’s core business values. These are the critical competencies that produce 
    growth, profitability, capital efficiency and risk exposure. In addition, financial materiality includes other economic, social and environmental factors such as a company’s ability to
     innovate, attract and retain talent, or anticipate regulatory changes.
