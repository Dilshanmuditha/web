    There is a great reliance on technology to solve environmental problems
around the world today, because of an almost universal reluctance by
governments and those who advise them to make the social and political
changes that would be necessary to reduce growth in production and
consumption. Yet the sorts of technological changes that would be necessary
to keep up with and counteract the growing environmental damage caused
by increases in production and consumption would have to be fairly
dramatic. The technological fixes of the past will not do. And the question
remains, can such a dramatic and radical redesign of our technological
systems occur without causing major social changes and will it occur
without a rethinking of political priorities? Technology is not independent of
society either in its shaping or its effects.

    Political activist George Bernard Shaw once said, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore 
    all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” Unconventional entrepreneurs who are solving some of the world’s most intractable economic, social, and environmental problems are also 
    creating rapidly expanding markets around the world. Because the unreasonable man doesn’t adapt to society, he is always creating innovation and expanding markets. If he simply followed 
    society like the reasonable man, economies and markets would remain stagnant, and current problems would persist. Nothing would improve, and great minds would never be given the opportunity
    ne. Therefore, innovation and progress depends on the unreasonable man and his ability to change society’s perception of entrepreneurialism. Richard Jefferson disrupted the way business was
     done when he saw a need for information sharing to benefit the greater good. He played a major role in the open source movement. Jefferson said that biological innovation in agriculture
      used to be cooperative for hundreds of years, but the recent explosion in the power of science to improve agriculture, medicine, health, and environment came with privatization of this
       knowledge that was once shared by all. He wanted to relieve restrictions from patents that constrained or hindered development and advancement of

    Technology, science and capacity building are major pillars of the Means of Implementation of the Post-2015 Agenda and of the Rio+20 follow-up processes. The research, development, 
    deployment, and widespread diffusion of environmentally sound technologies in the context of a Green Economy is also closely linked to other core elements and means of implementation, 
    including innovation, business opportunities and development, trade of environmental goods and services, finance and investment, and institutional capabilities.

    In order to eradicate poverty and reorient current unsustainable development trajectories over the period 2015 to 2030, affordable technological solutions have to be developed and 
    disseminated widely in the next fifteen years. The Means of Implementation of the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda could nevertheless provide an opportunity 
    to address some of the gaps hindering the facilitation and transfer of these technologies.

    In 2012, the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (“Rio+20”) called for identifying technology facilitation mechanism. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, in its paragraph 123, 
    decided to establish a technology facilitation mechanism. The mechanism will be launched at the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda in order 
    to support the sustainable development goals.
